# Contributing

Contributions welcome, but I have a day job and might not respond right away.

To contribute, open an Issue, provide relavent details, output, logs, and other
details. Tag it as a bug/enhancement/question or something appropriate.

If you want to make changes to the code, pull it, change it, push to a new
branch and open a PR.
